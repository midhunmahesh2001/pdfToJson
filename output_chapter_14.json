Before the discovery of\ntransistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called\nvalves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often\ncalled plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes \u2013 cathode,\nplate and grid; tetrode and pentode \\(respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes\\).\nIn a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and\nthe controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying\nthe voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the\ninter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their\nenergy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices\nthe electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one\ndirection). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves.\nThese vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate\ngenerally at high voltages \\(~100 V\\) and have limited life and low reliability.\nThe seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor\nelectronics goes back to 1930\u2019s when it was realised that some solid-\nstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling\nthe number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them.\nSimple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change\nthe number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply\nChapter Fourteen\nSEMICONDUCTOR\nELECTRONICS:\nMATERIALS, DEVICES\nAND SIMPLE CIRCUITS\n2024-25\nPhysics\n324\nand flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the\nsolid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons\nwere obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an\nevacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space\nis required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume\nlow power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability.\nEven the Cathode Ray Tubes \\(CRT\\) used in television and computer\nmonitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced\nby Liquid Crystal Display \\(LCD\\) monitors with supporting solid state\nelectronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices\nwas formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead\nsulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as\ndetector of radio waves.\nIn the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of\nsemiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like\njunction diodes \\(a 2-electrode device\\) and bipolar junction transistor (a\n3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also\nbe described.\n14.2 CLASSIFICATION OF METALS, CONDUCTORS AND\nSEMICONDUCTORS\nOn the basis of conductivity\nOn the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity \\(s \\) or resistivity\n\\(r = 1/s \\), the solids are broadly classified as:\n\\(i\\) Metals: They possess very low resistivity \\(or high conductivity\\).\nr ~ 10\u20132 \u2013 10\u20138 W m\ns ~ 102 \u2013 108 S m\u20131\n\\(ii\\) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate\nto metals and insulators.\nr ~ 10\u20135 \u2013 106 W m\ns ~ 105 \u2013 10\u20136 S m\u20131\n\\(iii\\)Insulators: They have high resistivity \\(or low conductivity\\).\nr ~ 1011 \u2013 1019 W m\ns ~ 10\u201311 \u2013 10\u201319 S m\u20131\nThe values of r and s given above are indicative of magnitude and\ncould well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity\nare not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and\nsemiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which\nwill become clear as we go along in this chapter.\nOur interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which\ncould be:\n\\(i\\)\nElemental semiconductors: Si and Ge\n\\(ii\\) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:\n\u00b7 Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc.\n\u00b7 Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc.\n\u00b7 Organic polymers:  polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc.\nMost of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on\nelemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic\nsemiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using\n2024-25\n325\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\norganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been\ndeveloped signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-\nelectronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict\nourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly\nelemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced\nhere for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply\nto most of the compound semiconductors as well.\nOn the basis of energy bands\nAccording to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of\nany of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom.\nInside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands.  The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all\nthe valence electrons will reside in the valence band. If the lowest level in\nthe conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the\nvalence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into\nthe conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors.\nIf there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band.\nAt the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band\nwhere other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the\npossibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as\ndue to vacancies in the valence band.\nLet us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing\nN atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit \\(n = 3\\), while for Ge\nit is the fourth orbit \\(n = 4\\). The number of electrons in the outermost\norbit is 4 \\(2s and 2p electrons\\). Hence, the total number of outer electrons\nin the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the\nouter orbit is 8 \\(2s + 6p electrons\\). So, for the 4N valence electrons there\nare 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either\nform a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands\ndepending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box\non Band Theory of Solids).\nAt the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,\nthe energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are\nseparated by an energy gap Eg \\(Fig. 14.1\\). The lower band which is\ncompletely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute\nzero is the valence band.  The other band consisting of 4N energy states,\ncalled the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n326\nThe lowest energy level in the\nconduction band is shown as EC and\nhighest energy level in the valence band\nis shown as EV. Above EC and below EV\nthere are a large number of closely spaced\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1.\nThe gap between the top of the  valence\nband and bottom of the conduction band\nis called the energy band gap (Energy gap\nEg). It may be large, small, or zero,\ndepending upon the material. These\ndifferent situations, are depicted in Fig.\n14.2 and discussed below:\nCase I: This refers to a situation, as\nshown in Fig. 14.2\\(a\\). One can have a\nmetal either when the conduction band\nis partially filled and the balanced band\nis partially empty or when the conduction\nand valance bands overlap. When there\nis overlap electrons from valence band can\neasily move into the conduction band.\nThis situation makes a  large number of\nelectrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is\npartially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level\nmaking conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials\nis low or the conductivity is high.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.2</figure> Difference between energy bands of \\(a\\) metals,\n\\(b\\) insulators and \\(c\\) semiconductors.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.1</figure> The energy band positions in a\nsemiconductor at 0 K. The upper band, called the\nconduction band, consists of infinitely large number\nof closely spaced energy states. The lower band,\ncalled the valence band, consists of closely spaced\ncompletely filled energy states.\n2024-25\n327\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nCase II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2\\(b\\), a large band gap Eg exists\n\\(Eg > 3 eV\\). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore\nno electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large\nthat electrons cannot be excited from the valence band  to the conduction\nband by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators.\nCase III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2\\(c\\). Here a finite but small\nband gap \\(Eg < 3 eV\\) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room\ntemperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough\nenergy to cross the energy gap and enter the  conduction band. These\nelectrons \\(though small in numbers\\) can move in the conduction band.\nHence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the\ninsulators.\nIn this section we have made a broad classification of metals,\nconductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will\nlearn the conduction process in semiconductors.\n"

                    "content": "We shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose\nlattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures\nare called the  diamond-like structures. Each atom is\nsurrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that\nSi and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline\nstructure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its\nfour valence electrons with each of its four nearest\nneighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron\nfrom each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs\nare referred to as forming a  covalent bond or simply a\nvalence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed\nto shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms\nholding them together strongly. Figure 14.4 schematically\nshows the 2-dimensional representation of Si or Ge\nstructure shown in Fig. 14.3 which overemphasises the\ncovalent bond. It shows an idealised picture in which no\nbonds are broken \\(all bonds are intact\\). Such a situation\narises at low temperatures. As the temperature increases,\nmore thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of\nthese electrons may break\u2013away (becoming free electrons contributing to\nconduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the\ncrystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5\\(a\\).\nThe neighbourhood, from which the free electron \\(with charge \u2013q\\) has come\nout leaves a vacancy with an effective charge \\(+q\\). This vacancy with the\neffective positive electronic charge is called a hole. The hole behaves as an\napparent free particle with effective positive charge.\nIn intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, ne is equal to\nthe number of holes, nh.  That is\nne = nh = ni\n\\(14.1\\)\nwhere ni is called intrinsic carrier concentration.\nSemiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from\nelectrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown\n<figure>FIGURE 14.3</figure> Three-dimensional dia-\nmond-like crystal structure for Carbon,\nSilicon or Germanium with\nrespective lattice spacing a equal\nto 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 \u00c5.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n328\nin Fig. 14.5\\(a\\). The movement of holes can be\nvisualised as shown in Fig. 14.5\\(b\\). An electron\nfrom the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to\nthe vacant site 1 \\(hole\\). Thus, after such a jump,\nthe hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an\nelectron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has\nmoved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron\noriginally set free [Fig. 14.5\\(a\\)] is not involved\nin this process of hole motion. The free electron\nmoves completely independently as conduction\nelectron and gives rise to an electron current, Ie\nunder an applied electric field. Remember that\nthe motion of hole is only a convenient way of\ndescribing the actual motion of bound electrons,\nwhenever there is an empty bond anywhere in\nthe crystal. Under the action of an electric field,\nthese holes move towards negative potential\ngiving the hole current, Ih. The total current, I is\nthus the sum of the electron current Ie and the\nhole current Ih:\nI = Ie + Ih\n\\(14.2\\)\nIt may be noted that apart from the process of generation of conduction\nelectrons and holes, a simultaneous process of recombination occurs in\nwhich the electrons recombine with the holes. At equilibrium, the rate of\ngeneration is equal to the rate of recombination of charge carriers. The\nrecombination occurs due to an electron colliding with a hole.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.4</figure> Schematic two-dimensional\nrepresentation of Si or Ge structure showing\ncovalent bonds at low temperature\n\\(all bonds intact\\). +4 symbol\nindicates inner cores of Si or Ge.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.5</figure> \\(a\\) Schematic model of generation of hole at site 1 and conduction electron\ndue to thermal energy at moderate temperatures. \\(b\\) Simplified representation of\npossible thermal motion of a hole.

These\nthermally excited electrons at\nT > 0 K, partially occupy the\nconduction band. Therefore,\nthe energy-band diagram of an\nintrinsic semiconductor will be\nas shown in Fig. 14.6\\(b\\).

Why is C\ninsulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors?\nSolution  The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in\nthe second, third and fourth orbit.  Hence, energy required to take\nout an electron from these atoms \\(i.e., ionisation energy Eg\\) will be\nleast for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C.

                    "content": "The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its\ntemperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As\nsuch, no important electronic devices can be developed using these\nsemiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their\nconductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities.\nWhen a small amount, say, a few parts per million \\(ppm\\), of a suitable\nimpurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the\nsemiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate\naddition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms\nare called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor.\nThe dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure\nsemiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original\nsemiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain\nthis is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should\nbe nearly the same.\nThere are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si\nor Ge:\n\\(i\\)\nPentavalent \\(valency 5\\); like Arsenic \\(As\\), Antimony \\(Sb\\), Phosphorous\n\\(P\\), etc.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.6</figure> \\(a\\)  An intrinsic semiconductor at T = 0 K\nbehaves like insulator. \\(b\\)  At T > 0 K, four thermally generated\nelectron-hole pairs. The filled circles \\( \\) represent electrons\nand empty circles \\( \\) represent holes.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n330\n\\(ii\\) Trivalent \\(valency 3\\); like Indium \\(In\\),\nBoron \\(B\\), Aluminium \\(Al\\), etc.\nWe shall now discuss how the doping\nchanges the number of charge carriers (and\nhence the conductivity) of semiconductors.\nSi or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the\nPeriodic table and, therefore, we choose the\ndopant element from nearby fifth or third\ngroup, expecting and taking care that the\nsize of the dopant atom is nearly the same as\nthat of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent\nand trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two\nentirely different types of semiconductors as\ndiscussed below.\n\\(i\\)  n-type semiconductor\nSuppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent\nelement as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom\nof  +5 valency element  occupies the position\nof an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of\nits electrons bond with the four silicon\nneighbours while the fifth remains very\nweakly bound to its parent atom. This is\nbecause the four electrons participating in\nbonding are seen as part of the effective core\nof the atom by the fifth electron. As a result\nthe ionisation energy required to set this\nelectron free is very small and even at room\ntemperature it will be free to move in the\nlattice of the semiconductor. For example, the\nenergy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,\nand 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this\nelectron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump\nthe forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for\nsilicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor.  Thus, the\npentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and\nhence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made\navailable for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the\ndoping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature.\nOn the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number\nof holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature.\nIn a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons\nne is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated\nintrinsically, while the total number of holes nh is only due to the holes\nfrom the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would\nincrease due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the\nnumber of holes would get reduced further.\nThus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons\ncan be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic\n<figure>FIGURE 14.7</figure> \\(a\\) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb,\nP, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n-\ntype semiconductor, and \\(b\\) Commonly used\nschematic representation of n-type material\nwhich shows only the fixed cores of the\nsubstituent donors with one additional effective\npositive charge and its associated extra electron.\n2024-25\n331\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nsemiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons\nbecome the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers.\nThese semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type\nsemiconductors. For n-type semiconductors, we have,\nne >> nh\n\\(14.3\\)\n\\(ii\\)  p-type semiconductor\nThis is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity\nlike Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than\nSi or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with\nneighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to\noffer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth\nneighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as\nshown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice\nwants an electron in place of a hole, an electron  in the outer\norbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this\nvacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole\nis available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom\nbecomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth\nelectron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom\nof p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge\nalong with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8\\(b\\). It is\nobvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are\nin addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source\nof conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for\nsuch a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons\nare minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped\nwith trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors. For\np-type semiconductors, the recombination process will reduce\nthe number \\(ni\\)of intrinsically generated electrons to ne.\nWe have, for p-type semiconductors\nnh >> ne\n\\(14.4\\)\nNote that the crystal maintains an overall charge neutrality\nas the charge of additional charge carriers is just equal and\nopposite to that of the ionised cores in the lattice.\nIn extrinsic semiconductors, because of the abundance of\nmajority current carriers, the minority carriers produced\nthermally have more chance of meeting majority carriers and\nthus getting destroyed. Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of\ncurrent carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly\nhelps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers.\nThe semiconductor\u2019s energy band structure is affected by doping. In\nthe case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor\nimpurities \\(ED\\) and acceptor impurities \\(EA\\) also exist. In the energy band\ndiagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level ED is slightly\nbelow the bottom EC of the conduction band and electrons from this level\nmove into the conduction band with very small supply of energy. At room\ntemperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few \\(~1012\\)\natoms of Si get ionised.  So the conduction band will have most electrons\ncoming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9\\(a\\). Similarly,\n<figure>FIGURE 14.8</figure> \\(a\\) Trivalent\nacceptor atom \\(In, Al, B etc.\\)\ndoped in tetravalent Si or Ge\nlattice giving p-type semicon-\nductor. \\(b\\) Commonly used\nschematic representation of\np-type material which shows\nonly the fixed core of the\nsubstituent acceptor with\none effective additional\nnegative charge and its\nassociated hole.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n332\n EXAMPLE 14.2\nfor p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level EA is slightly above\nthe top EV of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9\\(b\\). With very small\nsupply of energy an electron from the valence band can jump to the level\nEA and ionise the acceptor negatively. (Alternately, we can also say that\nwith very small supply of energy the hole from level EA sinks down into\nthe valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain\nexternal energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get\nionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the\ndensity of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in\nthe extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a\nsemiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by\nnenh = ni\n2\n\\(14.5\\)\nThough the above description is grossly approximate and\nhypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals,\ninsulators and semiconductors \\(extrinsic and intrinsic\\) in a simple\nmanner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon\nthe energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C\n\\(diamond\\), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV,\nrespectively.

By adding\nprecisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer\ncan be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a\nsemiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and\nn-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.\nTwo important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:\ndiffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the\nconcentration of electrons \\(number of electrons per unit volume\\) is more\ncompared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type\nsemiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration\nof electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the\nconcentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side\nto n-side \\(p \u00ae n\\) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side \\(n \u00ae p\\). This\nmotion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction.\nWhen an electron diffuses from n \u00ae p, it leaves behind an ionised\ndonor on n-side. This ionised donor \\(positive charge\\) is immobile as it is\nbonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse\nfrom n \u00ae p, a layer of positive charge \\(or positive space-charge region\\) on\nn-side of the junction is developed.\nSimilarly, when a hole diffuses from p \u00ae n due to the concentration\ngradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor \\(negative charge\\) which is\nimmobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or\nnegative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed.\nThis space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known\nas depletion region as the electrons and holes  taking\npart in the initial movement across the junction depleted\nthe region of its free charges \\(Fig. 14.10\\). The thickness\nof depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a\nmicrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on\nn-side of the junction and negative space charge region\non p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from\npositive charge towards negative charge develops. Due\nto this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves\nto n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p-\nside. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field\nis called drift.  Thus a drift current, which is opposite in\ndirection to the diffusion current \\(Fig. 14.10\\) starts.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.10</figure> p-n junction\nformation process.\nFormation and working of p-n junction diode\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html\n2024-25\nPhysics\n334\n EXAMPLE 14.3\nInitially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small.\nAs the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions\non either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric\nfield strength  and hence drift current. This process continues\nuntil the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n\njunction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there\nis no net current.\nThe loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of\nelectron by the p-region causes a  difference of potential across\nthe junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is\nsuch as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of\nequilibrium exists. Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction. The\nn-material has lost electrons, and p material has acquired\nelectrons. The n material is thus positive relative to the p\nmaterial. Since this potential tends to prevent the movement of\nelectron from the n region into the p region, it is often called a\nbarrier potential.\nExample 14.3  Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and\nphysically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction?\nSolution  No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much\nlarger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing \\(~2 to 3 \u00c5\\) and hence\ncontinuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction\nwill behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers.\n"

It is a two terminal\ndevice. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented\nas shown in Fig. 14.12\\(b\\).\nThe direction of arrow indicates the conventional\ndirection of current (when the diode is under forward\nbias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered\nby applying an external voltage V across the diode. The\nsituation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium\n\\(without bias\\) is shown in Fig. 14.11\\(a\\) and \\(b\\).\n14.6.1  p-n junction diode under forward bias\nWhen an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such\nthat p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side\nto the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13\\(a\\)], it is said to be forward biased.\nThe applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the\nvoltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible.\n(This is because the resistance of the depletion region \u2013 a region where\nthere are no charges \u2013 is very high compared to the resistance of  n-side\nand p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage \\(V \\) is opposite to the\n<figure>FIGURE 14.11</figure> \\(a\\) Diode under\nequilibrium \\(V = 0\\), \\(b\\) Barrier\npotential under no bias.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.12</figure> \\(a\\) Semiconductor diode,\n\\(b\\) Symbol for p-n junction diode.\nn\np\n2024-25\n335\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nbuilt-in potential V0. As a result, the depletion layer width\ndecreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13\\(b\\)]. The\neffective barrier height under forward bias is \\(V0 \u2013 V \\).\nIf the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be\nreduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a\nsmall number of carriers in the material\u2014those that happen to\nbe in the uppermost energy levels\u2014will possess enough energy\nto cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase\nthe applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced\nand more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus\nthe current increases.\nDue to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the\ndepletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority\ncarries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach\nthe n-side \\(where they are minority carries\\). This process under\nforward bias is known as minority carrier injection. At the\njunction boundary, on each side, the minority carrier\nconcentration increases significantly compared to the locations\nfar from the junction.\nDue to this concentration gradient, the injected electrons on\np-side diffuse from the junction edge of p-side to the other end\nof p-side. Likewise, the injected holes on n-side diffuse from the\njunction edge of n-side to the other end of n-side\n\\(Fig. 14.14\\). This motion of charged carriers on either side\ngives rise to current. The total diode forward current is sum\nof hole diffusion current and conventional current due to\nelectron diffusion. The magnitude of this current is usually\nin mA.\n14.6.2  p-n junction diode under reverse bias\nWhen an external voltage \\(V \\) is applied across the diode such\nthat n-side is positive and p-side is negative, it is said to be\nreverse biased [Fig.14.15\\(a\\)]. The applied voltage mostly\ndrops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same\nas the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases\nand the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field.\nThe effective barrier height under reverse bias is \\(V0 + V \\), [Fig. 14.15\\(b\\)].\nThis suppresses the flow of electrons from n \u00ae p and holes from p \u00ae n.\nThus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode\nunder forward bias.\nThe electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on\np-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the\njunction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers\ngives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA. This is\nquite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority\nside to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also\nthere under forward bias but it is negligible \\(mA\\) when compared with\ncurrent due to injected carriers which is usually in mA.\nThe diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied\nvoltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers\nfrom one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current\n<figure>FIGURE 14.13</figure> \\(a\\) p-n\njunction diode under forward\nbias, \\(b\\) Barrier potential\n\\(1\\) without battery, \\(2\\) Low\nbattery voltage, and \\(3\\) High\nvoltage battery.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.14</figure> Forward bias\nminority carrier injection.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n336\nis not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is\nlimited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either\nside of the junction.\nThe current under reverse bias is essentially voltage\nindependent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as\nbreakdown voltage \\(Vbr \\). When V = Vbr, the diode reverse current\nincreases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes\nlarge change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by\nan external circuit below the rated value (specified by the\nmanufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed. Once it exceeds\nthe rated value, the diode gets destroyed due to overheating. This\ncan happen even for the diode under forward bias, if the forward\ncurrent exceeds the rated value.\nThe circuit arrangement for studying the V-I characteristics\nof a diode, (i.e., the variation of current as a function of applied\nvoltage) are shown in Fig. 14.16\\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The battery is connected\nto the diode through a potentiometer \\(or reheostat\\) so that the\napplied voltage to the diode can be changed. For different values\nof voltages, the value of the current is noted. A graph between V\nand I is obtained as in Fig. 14.16\\(c\\). Note that in forward bias\nmeasurement, we use a milliammeter since the expected current is large\n\\(as explained in the earlier section\\) while a micrometer is used in reverse\nbias to measure the current. You can see in Fig. 14.16\\(c\\) that in forward\n<figure>FIGURE 14.15</figure> \\(a\\) Diode\nunder reverse bias,\n\\(b\\) Barrier potential under\nreverse bias.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.16</figure> Experimental circuit arrangement for studying V-I characteristics of\na p-n junction diode \\(a\\) in forward bias, \\(b\\) in reverse bias. \\(c\\) Typical V-I\ncharacteristics of a silicon diode.\n2024-25\n337\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\n EXAMPLE 14.4\nbias, the current first increases very slowly, almost negligibly, till the\nvoltage across the diode crosses a certain value. After the characteristic\nvoltage, the diode current increases significantly \\(exponentially\\), even for\na very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the\nthreshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and\n~0.7 V for silicon diode).\nFor the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small \\(~mA\\) and almost\nremains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation\ncurrent. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down\nvoltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode\nis discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not\nused beyond the reverse saturation current region.\nThe above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly\nallows the flow of current only in one direction \\(forward bias\\). The forward\nbias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This\nproperty is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next\nsection.

                    "content": "From the V-I characteristic of a junction diode we see that it allows current\nto pass only when it is forward biased. So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier.\nIf an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes.\n(The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nis a current through the load resistor RL and we\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18\\(b\\),\nwhereas there is no current in the negative half-\ncycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get\nthe output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is\nrestricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier.\nThe circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19\\(a\\), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the\nsecondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it\nis called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19\\(c\\) the\nvoltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.\nEach diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate\ncycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-\ntap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that\nthere is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-\ntap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A\n<figure>FIGURE 14.18</figure> \\(a\\) Half-wave rectifier\ncircuit, \\(b\\) Input ac voltage and output\nvoltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit.\n2024-25\n339\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nwith respect to the centre tap at any instant\nis positive. It is clear that, at that instant,\nvoltage at B being out of phase will be\nnegative as shown in Fig.14.19\\(b\\). So, diode\nD1 gets forward biased and conducts (while\nD2 being reverse biased is not conducting).\nHence, during this positive half cycle we get\nan output current (and a output voltage\nacross the load resistor RL) as shown in\nFig.14.19\\(c\\). In the course of the ac cycle\nwhen the voltage at A becomes negative with\nrespect to centre tap, the voltage at B would\nbe positive. In this part of the cycle diode\nD1 would not conduct but diode D2 would,\ngiving an output current and output\nvoltage \\(across RL\\) during the negative half\ncycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output\nvoltage during both the positive as well as\nthe negative half of the cycle. Obviously,\nthis is a more efficient circuit for getting\nrectified voltage or current than the half-\nwave rectifier.\nThe rectified voltage is in the form of\npulses of the shape of half sinusoids.\nThough it is unidirectional it does not have\na steady value. To get steady dc output\nfrom the pulsating voltage normally a\ncapacitor is connected across the output\nterminals \\(parallel to the load RL\\). One can\nalso use an inductor in series with RL for\nthe same purpose. Since these additional\ncircuits appear to filter out the ac ripple\nand give a pure dc voltage, so they are\ncalled filters.\nNow we shall discuss the role of\ncapacitor in filtering. When the voltage\nacross the capacitor is rising, it gets\ncharged. If there is no external load, it remains charged to the peak voltage\nof the rectified output. When there is a load, it gets discharged through\nthe load and the voltage across it begins to fall. In the next half-cycle of\nrectified output it again gets charged to the peak value \\(Fig. 14.20\\). The\nrate of fall of the voltage across the capacitor depends inversely upon the\nproduct of capacitance C and the effective resistance RL used in the circuit\nand is called the time constant.  To make the time constant large value of\nC should be large. So capacitor input filters use large capacitors. The\noutput voltage obtained by using capacitor input filter is nearer to the\npeak voltage of the rectified voltage. This type of filter is most widely\nused in power supplies.\n<figure>FIGURE 14.19</figure> \\(a\\) A Full-wave rectifier\ncircuit; \\(b\\) Input wave forms given to the\ndiode D1 at A and to the diode D2 at B;\n\\(c\\) Output waveform across the\nload RL connected in the full-wave\nrectifier circuit.\n2024-25\nPhysics\n340\n<figure>FIGURE 14.20</figure> \\(a\\) A full-wave rectifier with capacitor filter, \\(b\\) Input and output\nvoltage of rectifier in \\(a\\).\nSUMMARY\n1.\nSemiconductors are the basic materials used in the present solid state\nelectronic devices like diode, transistor, ICs, etc.\n2.\nLattice structure and the atomic structure of constituent elements\ndecide whether a particular material will be insulator, metal or\nsemiconductor.\n3.\nMetals have low resistivity \\(10\u20132 to 10\u20138 Wm\\), insulators have very high\nresistivity \\(>108 W m\u20131\\), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity.\n4.\nSemiconductors are elemental \\(Si, Ge\\) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.).\n5.\nPure semiconductors are called \u2018intrinsic semiconductors\u2019.

The\nnumber of electrons \\(ne\\) is equal to the number of holes \\(nh \\) in intrinsic\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge.\n6.\nThe number of charge carriers can be changed by  \u2018doping\u2019 of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors.

Further, the material possesses an overall charge\nneutrality.\n10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence\nband energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap \\(Eg\\) between the top of valence band \\(EV \\) and the bottom of the\nconduction band EC. The electrons from valence band can be excited by\n2024-25\n341\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nheat, light or electrical energy to the conduction band and thus, produce\na change in the current flowing in a semiconductor.\n11. For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors Eg is 0.2 eV to 3 eV, while\nfor metals Eg \u00bb 0.\n12. p-n junction is the \u2018key\u2019 to all semiconductor devices. When such a\njunction is made, a \u2018depletion layer\u2019 is formed consisting of immobile\nion-cores devoid of their electrons or holes. This is responsible for a\njunction potential barrier.\n13. By changing the external applied voltage, junction barriers can be\nchanged. In forward bias (n-side is connected to negative terminal of the\nbattery and p-side is connected to the positive), the barrier is decreased\nwhile the barrier increases in reverse bias. Hence, forward bias current\nis more \\(mA\\) while it is very small \\(mA\\) in a p-n junction diode.\n14. Diodes can be used for rectifying an ac voltage (restricting the ac voltage\nto one direction).

The energies are the overall averages. When you see a picture in\nwhich EC or EV are drawn as straight lines, then they should be\nrespectively taken simply as the bottom of conduction band energy levels\nand top of valence band energy levels.\n2.\nIn elemental semiconductors \\(Si or Ge\\), the n-type or p-type\nsemiconductors are obtained by introducing \u2018dopants\u2019 as defects. In\ncompound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio\ncan also change the type of semiconductor.

It can be seen with an explicit ray\ndiagram that the answer is independent of the location of the slab\n\\(for small angles of incidence\\).\n9.17\n\\(a\\)\nsin i\u00a2c = 1.44/1.68 which gives  i\u00a2c  = 59\u00b0. Total internal reflection\ntakes place  when i > 59\u00b0 or when r < rmax = 31\u00b0. Now,\n(sin\n/sin\n)\n.\nmax\nmax\ni\nr\n= 1 68 , which gives imax  ~  60\u00b0. Thus, all\nincident rays of angles in the range 0 < i < 60\u00b0 will suffer total\ninternal reflections in the pipe. (If the length of the pipe is\nfinite, which it is in practice, there will be a lower limit on i\ndetermined by the ratio of the diameter to the length of the\npipe.)\n\\(b\\)\nIf there is no outer coating, i\u00a2c = sin\u20131\\(1/1.68\\) = 36.5\u00b0. Now,\ni = 90\u00b0 will have r = 36.5\u00b0  and  i\u00a2 = 53.5\u00b0 which is greater than\ni\u00a2c. Thus, all incident rays \\(in the range 53.5\u00b0 < i < 90\u00b0\\) will\nsuffer total internal reflections.\n9.18\nFor fixed distance s between object and screen, the lens equation\ndoes not give a real solution for u or v if f is greater than s/4.\nTherefore,  fmax = 0.75 m.\n9.19\n21.4 cm\n9.20\n\\(a\\)\n\\(i\\) Let a parallel beam be the incident from the left on the convex\nlens first.\nf1 = 30 cm and u1 = \u2013 \uf0a5, give  v1 = + 30 cm. This image becomes\na virtual object for the second lens.\nf2 = \u201320 cm, u 2 = + \\(30 \u2013 8\\) cm = +  22 cm which gives,\nv2 = \u2013 220 cm. The parallel incident beam appears to diverge\nfrom a point 216 cm from the centre of the two-lens system.\n\\(ii\\) Let the parallel beam be incident from the left on the concave\nlens  first: f1 = \u2013 20 cm, u1 = \u2013 \u00a5, give v1 = \u2013 20 cm. This image\nbecomes a real object for the second lens: f2 = + 30 cm, u2 =\n\u2013 \\(20 + 8\\) cm = \u2013 28 cm which gives, v2 = \u2013 420 cm. The parallel\nincident beam appears to diverge from a point 416 cm on the\nleft of the centre of the two-lens system.\nClearly, the answer depends on which side of the lens system\nthe parallel beam is incident. Further we do not have a simple lens\nequation true for all u \\(and v\\) in terms of a definite constant of the\nsystem  (the constant being determined by f1 and f2, and the separation\nbetween the lenses). The notion of effective focal length, therefore,\ndoes not seem to be meaningful for this system.\n\\(b\\)\nu1 = \u2013 40 cm, f1 = 30 cm, gives v1= 120 cm.\nMagnitude of magnification due to the first \\(convex\\) lens is 3.\nu 2 = + \\(120 \u2013 8\\) cm = +112 cm \\(object virtual\\);\nf2 = \u2013 20 cm which gives v2\n112\n20\n92\n= \u2212\n\u00d7\ncm\nMagnitude of magnification due to the second \\(concave\\)\n2024-25\n348\nPhysics\nlens = 20/92.\nNet magnitude of magnification = 0.652\nSize of the image = 0.98 cm\n9.21\nIf the refracted ray in the prism is incident on the second face at the\ncritical angle ic, the angle of refraction r at the first face is \\(60\u00b0\u2013ic\\).\nNow, ic = sin\u20131 \\(1/1.524\\) ~ 41\u00b0\nTherefore, r = 19\u00b0\nsin i =  0.4962; i  ~ 30\u00b0\n9.22\n\\(a\\)\n1\n1\n9\n1\n10\nv\n+\n=\ni.e.,\nv = \u2013 90 cm,\nMagnitude of magnification = 90/9 = 10.\nEach square in the virtual image  has an area 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1 mm2\n= 100 mm2 = 1 cm2\n\\(b\\)\nMagnifying power = 25/9 = 2.8\n\\(c\\)\nNo, magnification of an image by a lens and angular magnification\n\\(or magnifying power\\) of an optical instrument are two separate\nthings. The latter is the ratio of the angular size of the object\n(which is equal to the angular size of the image even if the image\nis magnified) to the angular size of the object if placed at the near\npoint \\(25 cm\\). Thus, magnification magnitude is |\\(v/u\\)| and\nmagnifying power is \\(25/ |u|\\). Only when the image is located at\nthe near point |v| = 25 cm, are the two quantities equal.\n9.23\n\\(a\\)\nMaximum magnifying power is obtained when the image is at\nthe near point \\(25 cm\\)\nu =  \u2013 7.14 cm.\n\\(b\\)\nMagnitude of magnification = \\(25/ |u|\\) = 3.5.\n\\(c\\)\nMagnifying power  = 3.5\nYes, the magnifying power \\(when the image is produced at 25 cm\\)\nis equal to the magnitude of magnification.\n9.24\nMagnification  = \n( .\n/ )\n6 25\n1  = 2.5\n            v = +2.5u\n     \uf02b\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n1\n2 5\n1\n1\n10\n. u\nu\ni.e.,u = \u2013 6 cm\n|v| = 15 cm\nThe virtual image is closer than the normal  near point \\(25 cm\\) and\ncannot be seen by the eye distinctly.\n9.25\n\\(a\\)\nEven though the absolute image size is bigger than the object\nsize, the angular size of the image is equal to the angular size of\nthe object. The magnifier helps in the following way: without it\nobject would be placed no closer than 25 cm;  with it the object\ncan be placed much closer. The closer object has larger angular\nsize than the same object at 25 cm. It is in this sense that angular\nmagnification is achieved.\n\\(b\\)\nYes, it decreases a little because the angle subtended at the eye\nis then slightly less than the angle subtended at the lens. The\n2024-25\n349\nAnswers\neffect is negligible if the image is at a very large distance away.\n[Note: When the eye is separated from the lens, the angles\nsubtended at the eye by the first object and its image are not\nequal.]\n\\(c\\)\nFirst, grinding lens of very small focal length is not easy. More\nimportant, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical\nand chromatic) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you\ncannot  get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple\nconvex lens. However, using an aberration corrected lens system,\none can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.\n\\(d\\)\nAngular magnification of eye-piece is [\\(25/fe\\) + 1] \\( fe in cm\\) which\nincreases if fe is smaller. Further, magnification of the objective\nis given by   \nO\nO\nO\nO\n1\n|\n|\n(|\n|/\n)\n1\nv\nu\nu\nf\n=\n\u2212\nwhich is large when  \nO\n|\n|\nu\n is slightly greater than fO. The micro-\nscope is used for viewing very close object. So \nO\n|\n|\nu\n is small, and\nso is fO.\n\\(e\\)\nThe image of the objective in the eye-piece is known as \u2018eye-ring\u2019.\nAll the rays from the object refracted by objective go through the\neye-ring. Therefore, it is an ideal position for our eyes for viewing.\nIf we place our eyes too close to the eye-piece, we shall not collect\nmuch of the light and also reduce our field of view. If we position\nour eyes on the eye-ring and the area of the pupil of our eye is\ngreater or equal to the area of the eye-ring, our eyes will collect\nall the light refracted by the objective. The precise location of\nthe eye-ring naturally depends on the separation between the\nobjective and the eye-piece. When you view through a microscope\nby placing your eyes on one end,the ideal distance between the\neyes and eye-piece is usually built-in the design of the\ninstrument.\n9.26\nAssume microscope in normal use i.e., image at 25 cm.

The\nseparation between the objective and the eye-piece should be (7.5 +\n4.17) cm = 11.67 cm. Further the object should be placed 1.5 cm from\nthe objective to obtain the desired magnification.\n9.27\n\\(a\\)\nm = \\( fO/fe\\) = 28\n\\(b\\)\nm = f\nf\nf\ne\nO\nO\n1\n25\n+\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa = 33.6\n2024-25\n350\nPhysics\n9.28\n\\(a\\)\nfO + fe = 145 cm\n\\(b\\)\nAngle subtended by the tower = \\(100/3000\\) = \\(1/30\\) rad.\nAngle subtended by the image produced by the objective\n=  \nO\n140\nh\nh\nf\n=\nEquating  the two, h = 4.7 cm.\n            \\(c\\)\nMagnification \\(magnitude\\) of the eye-piece = 6.

Parallel rays coming from the object\nat infinity will focus at a distance of 110 mm from the larger mirror.\nThe distance of virtual object for the smaller mirror = \\(110 \u201320\\) =\n90 mm. The focal length of smaller mirror is 70 mm. Using the mirror\nformula, image is formed at 315 mm from the smaller mirror.\n9.30\nThe reflected rays get deflected by twice the angle of rotation of the\nmirror. Therefore, d/1.5 = tan 7\u00b0.
